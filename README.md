# Supermarket_system

The aim of my app was to find the best price to a set of items by applying a range of discounts

I created a very basic front end system for the user to input however many of each product they would like, with an alert to display the price and savings made. In a real application, this would not be a hard coded html form, but created based on passed through values from PHP. As I do not have PHP Unit Testing experience, this was the way I tested my system. I followed the Use Cases that I have included in the Plan documentation.

I have commented throughout the application why I have chosen to do each step the way I have. I have had expandability in mind, but as stated elsewhere, when creating a quick demo project, the solution that is reached is not always necessarily going to be the most elegant or streamlined. Taking this into a real world application would involve the use of more classes, database connections and teamwork/discussions. I would also ensure getters/setters were applied to the classes.
